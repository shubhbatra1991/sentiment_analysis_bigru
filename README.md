What is sentiment analysis?
Opinion mining (OM), also known as sentiment analysis (SA), is the computer study of people's attitudes, opinions, and feelings regarding an object. The thing can stand in for people, things, or things. Reviews are more likely to cover these subjects. The terms SA and OM can both be used in the same sentence. They both convey the same notion. However, according to some experts, OM and SA have somewhat distinct ideas. Sentiment Analysis finds the sentiment represented in a text and then evaluates it, whereas Opinion Mining extracts and studies people's opinions about an entity. Therefore, the goal of SA is to uncover viewpoints, recognize the feelings they convey, and then categorize their polarity

why is this necessary?

Gap in between techniques used till yet for sarcasm and sentiment analysis.
Better approach for such solutions like NLP.
Sarcasm Detector works on such type of dataset (eg. News headline dataset- Twitter)
Limited resources for sarcasm identification based on sentences (sentiment analysis)
Biased Dataset used for analysis that results in better accuracy. 



What is being achieved in terms of analysis?

Bi GRU gives better result than LSTM and Bi LSTM and should be used further for deep analysis. It can present data in accumulated manner.
For enhancing the sentiment analysis, we can add few more layers in LSTM and work on the accuracy of model.
Accuracy of 55 percentile detected while doing sarcasm detection.
